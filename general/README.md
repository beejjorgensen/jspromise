# General Promise Examples

Though these techniques can be used in the browser, the files are built
to be run with Node for demo purposes.

Most of these are Promise usage examples, but there are three files that
define new Promises:

* `delay.js`: implementation of an n-second delay
* `delay-sqrt.js`: computes sqrt(n) after a 1-second delay, new Promise
  implementation
* `delay-sqrt-await.js`: computes sqrt(n) after a 1-second delay,
  async/await implementation
